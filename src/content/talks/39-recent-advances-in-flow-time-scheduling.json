  "title": "Recent advances in flow time scheduling",
  "abstract": "Flow time is one of the most natural metrics to optimize in scheduling, but algorithmically it can be notoriously difficult to handle. I will talk about some recent advances in this topic, focusing on two results by myself and co-authors: a PTAS for the sum of weighted flow times on a single machine and improved approximation guarantees for parallel unrelated machines. The first result is enabled by a study of structural properties of constraints in a natural ILP formulation and the second result relies on a novel connection to discrepancy theory.",
