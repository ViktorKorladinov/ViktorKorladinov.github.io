  "title": "Vehicle routing: A focus on heuristic design",
  "abstract": "Local search-based algorithms have tended towards incorporating an ever-increasing number of heuristics for different problem classes, for example all sorts of vehicle routing generalizations. These heuristics range from all-purpose `swap' and `insert' to complicated made-to-measure operators. It has become a challenge to determine the impact of individual components on an algorithm's performance. In contrast to targeting generalizing problem extensions, it may be worthwhile to focus on a problem's core when designing a basic optimization heuristic. This talk introduces a recently published local search operator for vehicle routing problems: SISRs. This heuristic is unique insofar as it seeks to induce `spatial' and `capacity' slack during a ruin phase which may subsequently be exploited in an almost-greedy recreate phase. SISRs emerged after a dedicated attempt towards solving the vehicle routing problem's most basic special case, that is the `capacitated VRP'. SISRs' quality is validated by way of demonstrating its performance across a wide and diverse range of VRP generalizations. This confirms that the basic CVRP ruin & recreate heuristic is also effective when applied to more general vehicle problems, including fleet minimization, without the need to design additional problem-specific components.",
