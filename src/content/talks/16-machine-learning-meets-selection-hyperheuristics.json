  "title": "Machine Learning meets Selection Hyper-heuristics",
  "abstract": "Hyper-heuristics are powerful search methodologies that operate on low level heuristics or heuristic components to tackle computationally hard optimisation problems. The current state-of-the-art in hyper-heuristic research contains classes of algorithms that focus on intelligently selecting or generating a suitable heuristic for a given situation. Hence, there are two main types of hyper-heuristics: selection and generation hyper-heuristics. A typical selection hyper-heuristic chooses a low-level heuristic and applies it to the current solution at each step of a search, before deciding whether to accept or reject the newly created solution. Generation hyper-heuristics, in contrast, automatically build heuristics or heuristic components during the search process. Machine learning is revolutionising various fields, and its integration with hyper-heuristics holds immense potential. This talk will first offer a concise overview of hyper-heuristics, followed by illustrative case studies demonstrating how we have successfully applied machine learning to automatically design more effective selection hyper-heuristics.",
