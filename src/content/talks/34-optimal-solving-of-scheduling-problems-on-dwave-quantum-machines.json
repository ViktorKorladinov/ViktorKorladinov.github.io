  "title": "Optimal solving of scheduling problems on D-Wave quantum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmachines",
  "abstract": "The main disadvantage of calculations on real quantum computers is their non-determinism. For optimization problems, it is possible to get surprisingly good results using Quantum Annealing approach, but without a guarantee of the optimality of the result. Simply put, the quantum machine has not found anything better. In the presentation an approach that provides such a guarantee of optimality is proposed. A solution that is optimal in the strict mathematical sense is generated, without probabilistic considerations. For this purpose, a D-Wave quantum machine is used working as a sampler implementing quantum annealing -- an approach considered as a hardware metaheuristic -- to obtain upper and lower bounds on the value of the objective function of the problem under consideration. Then the mechanism of a Branch and Bound scheme is used and controlled by quantum annealing, which allows us to obtain very quickly -- in constant time for considered instances -- the boundaries of the considered subproblems. The whole idea is an alternately combination of calculations realized on QPU and CPU, allowing us to generate optimal solutions to the NP-hard problems of task scheduling on a single machine with a total weighted tardiness as well as with total number of tardy jobs criteria. The main result is the formulation of the lower bound in a \"language\" (i.e. mathematical model) understandable by a quantum machine.",
